    "> Inflation has had a direct impact on crime rates in Australia, whereas the years have gone by, crime rates correlating to finance have also increased. Inflation has increased household prices by 2.1% over the past 9 years.\n",

    "> Inflation is the gradual loss of monetary value of money, making prices of goods and services higher whilst also keeping wages the same. This in turn reduces living conditions where households aren't able to support their living conditions or housing prices, with the lower classes getting what was originally a stable housing plan, turned into an unlivable crisis in which costs such as healthcare or shelter need to be reduced to live in general. With the prices of essential goods getting higher other factors for living are needing to be sacrificed in order to compensate.\n",

    "> For example a couple with a stable job at an average company makes at least \\\\$20 per hour. With a weekly time of 38 hours with a 220 day workday would leave them with a \\\\$33,440 salary (After tax). This would just be enough for living conditions with rent being around \\\\$22,880 this would leave them with around \\\\$10,500. If the average weekly essential goods cost around \\\\$200 they would only have a few dollars left for recreational spending. If the prices for most of those goods were to go up through inflation the cost of essential goods would cross the rant prices, leading the worker to bankruptcy. This would lead to many people having no other choice than to resort to financial crime to fulfil their essential needs.\n",

This reflects upon the fact that most people are at their maximum output of water and the increased price of essential goods can make the water dirty too fast for the filtered water to catch up. Leading to both the fish and the person's life being polluted with no conventional way out.\n",
